    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions ❓</h2>
    <hr>
    <pre style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
        Can I freeze the cookie dough?❄
             Yes! You can freeze the dough for up to 3 months. Roll it into balls and freeze them on a baking sheet, then store them in a freezer bag.
        How can I make the cookies thicker?🍪
             Chill the dough in the fridge for 30 minutes before baking. This helps the cookies hold their shape and prevents them from spreading too much.
        What if I don't have brown sugar?🍬
             You can substitute granulated sugar with 1/2 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of molasses to make your own brown sugar.🍬🍯
